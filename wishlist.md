# i3wm
- move all windows in [current workspace] to workspace [num]
- containers
	- optionally preserve container layout when closing a window
	- open a window in a new container instead of splitting current container
		- Or, open an empty container
	- requires a manual WM instead of dynamic?
- command to move focus to previous window (bound to $mod+tab)
- better window rotation
	- figure out why $mod+e rotation sometimes does not work
# qutebrowser
- define custom command [mycommand] so :mycommand is valid
	- maybe just making aliases for existing commands will suite my needs... not sure
- swap ; and : as in my vimrc
# rofi
- figure out how to execute arbitrary commands
	- arithmetic?
- implement ~ directory file searching
